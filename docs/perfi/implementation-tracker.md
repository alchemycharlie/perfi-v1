  - `recharts` (charting)
  - Radix UI primitives (dialog, dropdown, tooltip, tabs, select, popover, toggle, slot)
  - `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` (class utilities)
  - `prettier`, `eslint-config-prettier` (formatting)
- Configured project tooling:
  - ESLint with Next.js + TypeScript + Prettier rules
  - Prettier with consistent formatting rules
  - `.editorconfig` for editor consistency
  - `.gitignore` for Next.js/Supabase/env files
  - npm scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`, `typecheck`, `check`
- Created full directory structure per Phase 4 architecture plan
- Created route group layouts:
  - `(marketing)` with header/footer placeholder
  - `(auth)` with centred card layout
  - `app/` with sidebar + top bar skeleton
  - `admin/` with admin sidebar skeleton
- Created placeholder pages for all 29 routes
- Created API route stubs: `/api/webhooks/stripe`, `/api/waitlist`, `/api/contact`
- Created error pages: `not-found.tsx`, `error.tsx`
- Created Supabase client structure: `client.ts`, `server.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `admin.ts`
- Created Stripe client foundation: `lib/stripe/config.ts`
- Created middleware with session refresh (auth guard logic placeholder for Phase 2)
- Created design tokens in `globals.css` per Phase 4 colour/spacing spec
- Created utility foundations: `cn`, `currency`, `dates`, `entitlements`
- Created Zod validation schema foundation with auth, contact, waitlist schemas
